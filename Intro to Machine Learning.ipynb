    "If we had a model of the world (like a perfect simulation) then we'd be able to solve all problems.\n",
    "We'd be able to simulate what the weather would be like tomorrow. \n",

    "**Building machines which can model the world (make accurate predictions about it) is the goal of AI.**\n",

    "However, we actually never have a perfect model of the world - the world is too complex!\n",
    "\n",
    "\"All models are wrong, but some are useful\" - George Box\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we can't have perfect models, we have to settle with predictive models. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve goals, animals have to understand how the world works. \n",
    "Over time they build up mental models of how the world behaves. \n",
    "If I see clouds I can predict how likely it is to rain.\n",
    "If I push this chair i can predict whether it will slide across the floor or topple over.\n",
    "For these simple examples, we can make pretty good predictions.\n",
    "This is probably because we have experienced a lot of similar situations, and can generalise\n",

    "### **Unsupervised learning** \n",
    "Where we only have an input and try to predict something useful as an output, without being explicitly shown examples of what the output should be. This  what data is likely to in order to better understand the underlying structure of it. E.g. we have data about houses and try to split these examples into different clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "Where our algorithm interacts with it's evironment and has to learn what actions to take to perform a task. E.g. we are trying to get an robot to walk or an algorithm to learn how to win at chess.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "Where we predict an output from a input, given examples of input-output pairs. E.g. we use different features about a house such as location, number of rooms, etc and try to predict the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, and the first series of lectures, we will be learning about supervised learning - where we have datasets with both input features and output labels. Later notebooks will cover unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. "
